This is all the programming assignments, Quizzes of the deeplearning specialization course. It is **only for the reference purpose.** Don't copy and paste for the plagarism assignments which deny coursera honor code. They are all only you get stuck on doing. It's all the treasure of deeplearning.ai team.

**Happy Learning!**
